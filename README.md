**TidyTabs** is an helpful Chrome extension designed to automatically declutter your browser. It manages open tabs through duplicate cleanup, configurable expiration rules, and a smart "snooze" feature to remind you of important pages later.

## Features

- **Duplicate Purging**: Automatically detects and closes duplicate tabs to save memory.
- **Auto-Close Expiration**: Set a timer (e.g., 7 days) to automatically close tabs you haven't touched in a while.
- **Smart Snooze**: Right-click any tab to "Snooze" it for later (30 mins, Tomorrow, Next Week, etc.). It closes now and reopens automatically when you need it.
- **Customizable Rules**: Choose to keep the active tab or the oldest tab, and exclude specific domains (e.g., music players) from auto-closing.
- **Privacy First**: All logic runs locally in your browser. No browsing history is sent to any server.

### Privacy
TidyTabs operates entirely within your browser using the Chrome Extension APIs. It does not collect, store, or transmit your browsing history to any external servers.
